## About the Book
Angular is a Single Page Application (SPA) development framework open-sourced by Google. The Angular framework is written in TypeScript language, which enables a web developer to write JavaScript code in Object-Oriented fashion. TypeScript makes it easier to build a client-side web application with classes, interfaces, generics, inheritance, and other Object-Oriented features. TypeScript compiler takes care of transpiling these features into native JavaScript. Angular is a framework that comes with Dependency Injection, HTTP communication, Forms, and other features out of the box.
